Thanks for wanting to help with this little project!

Our main goal for KHoutsider is making it as useful as it can be for the sake of archival and preservation of game music. Features like making downloads easier or faster, making the downloads into a single .zip file and such are mostly what I'm looking for right now.
I'm not currently interested in supporting other platforms (such as Sitting on Clouds).
